  abstract = {Research on the combustion of wood on a fixed grate with a separate supply of combustion air is described in this paper. From the layer of the wood on the grate, only fixed carbon was burned in the primary combustion chamber in the presence of primary air, whereas the volatiles were burned subsequently in the secondary combustion chamber in the presence of secondary air. A one-dimensional mathematical model describing the combustion in the overfeed layer of wood chips is given. Theoretical results were confirmed by the experiments carried out in the experimental furnace. The scheme of the experimental device and the results of experiments and calculations are presented. It was confirmed that the conditions in the layer and the quality of combustion were highly effected by the ratio of the fuel mass flow and mass flows of primary and secondary air. It was found that the ratio between primary and secondary air could be determined on the basis of the measured concentration of CO2 in flue gases leaving the burning layer. The optimum ratio of primary and secondary combustion air at any excess air was determined.},

  abstract = {Fixed-bed combustion in a tube reactor is a useful procedure to exploit a large variety of biomasses obtaining accurate in-bed data. In this paper, the ignition front propagation velocity is experimentally studied in a counter-current process for eight different biomass fuels with a wide range of origins, compositions and packing properties. Air mass flow rate is the main operative parameter and clearly distinguishes three stages of combustion (oxygen-limited, fuel limited and cooling by convection). The impact of the excess air ratio is also analyzed. This parameter confirmed that the maximum front velocity is achieved under sub-stoichiometric conditions, where the cooling effects of excessive air are minimized. Other variables with a major influence on the ignition front velocity are moisture and ash content. Finally, an uncertainty analysis is included to determine the accuracy of the entire measurement process.},

  abstract = {Agricultural residual biomass presents a high potential for energy use around the world, often not utilized to a large extent due to its significant differences with respect to other biomass types, such as the one of forest origin. These differences are mainly related to the characteristics of its ashes (quantity and composition) which increase certain problematic phenomena during combustion, among them bottom ash sintering and fly ash deposition. The main goal of this paper is the experimental study of these issues for four different agropellets made of residual agricultural biomass (one woody -vineyard pruning- and three blended with an herbaceous component -corn stover and/or barley straw-) and a forest wood pellet (used as a reference), evaluated under different operating conditions in a laboratory fixed bed reactor. The influence of inlet air flow and temperature on the sintering degree and deposition ratio has been analyzed in a systematic way. For the five biofuels, under tested conditions, a clear relation inversely proportional between air excess ratio and deposition ratio has been determined. Deposition was more substantial for the four agropellets; meanwhile the sintering degree was more important for the three with an herbaceous component. The information obtained in this research work is intended to help researchers and technologists to make choices regarding the design and operation of conversion systems adapted for agricultural residual biomass, enhancing its market penetration.},

  abstract = {A two-dimensional mathematical model for the combustion of straw in a cross-current, moving bed was developed as part of a tool for optimizing operating conditions and design parameters. To verify the model and to increase the understanding of straw bed combustion, laboratory fixed-bed experiments were performed in a 15cm diameter and 137cm long vertical reactor. Air was introduced through the bottom plate and the straw was ignited from the top with an electrical radiation source. The temperature was measured at eight positions within the bed and gas analysis was performed for O2, CO2, CO, CxHy, NOx, NH3 and SO2. The inlet air flow rate and air preheat temperature were varied. The experimental data for ignition front temperatures and front propagation velocity compared reasonably well with the modelling results. A higher air inlet temperature resulted in lower maximum bed temperatures, which was successfully modelled. A limited parameter analysis study was performed. Measurement of NO from the bed showed that, within the air inlet flow rates investigated, the conversion of fuel nitrogen to NO decreased with increasing air flow rate during ignition front propagation, while the conversion increased during the char burnout phase.},
