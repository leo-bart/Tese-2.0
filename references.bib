Proper non-linear constraints are selected to avoid high-frequency transverse or shear oscillations of the beam. The results show that harmful oscillations can be successfully eliminated from the beam response and efficiency of the numerical solution improves when these constraints are used in the solution procedure. In case of a swinging pendulum, the calculation speed could be improved, when compared to the non-constrained case. It was found that the overall performance of the Lagrange multiplier method with Baumgarte's stabilization and carefully selected stabilization parameters was the best approach.},

	abstract = {Two main factors for design of railway vehicles are stability and curving performance. Running performances, result from stiffness design of a primary suspension, between stability and curving are contrary to each other. The more longitudinal stiffness of a primary suspension stiff, the better straight performance is outstanding, however, curving performance is degenerated. Also, if the less longitudinal stiffness stiff, running performance has opposite characteristics. Curving performance of railway vehicles should be outstanding on small curved track which is in cities. If curving performance is improved, lateral contact force (i.e. flange contact force) of wheel and rail is decreased by improved spring so, wear and noise of wheels are decreased. Derailment risk from wheel and rail contact, of course, is decreased. Thus, it's important to design an axle spring of a primary suspension. The design of ensuring stability performance, of course, should be precede. An axle spring is designed using FEM tool which is ABAQUS also, rubber like material is modeled by Mooney-Rivlin model. Developed FE-axle spring model is analyzed and is produced also, this model is validated by test results of a load tester.},

	abstract = {Ballasted railway tracks will settle as a result of permanent deformations in the ballast and in the underlying material layers. The settlement is caused by the repeated traffic loading and the severity of the settlement depends on the quality and the behaviour of the ballast, the sub-ballast, and the subgrade.
            As the behaviour of the material is not exactly the same under all sleepers, and since the loading of the track is irregular, the amount of settlement will differ from one sleeper to another. A result of this is that the sleepers are not always fully supported, and some sleepers may even become completely unsupported (voided). A gap appears between the sleeper and the ballast bed. As soon as the track geometry starts to deteriorate, the variations of the train/track interaction force increase, and this speeds up the track deterioration rate.
            This paper presents a computer model by which the dynamic train/track interaction can be simulated. The influence of one or several voided sleepers on the train/track interaction force and on the track dynamics is investigated. Track settlement due to hanging sleeper(s) is discussed.},

The action of spin is to twist the area of contact. Surface tractions resulting from this rotation are found, which demonstrate the necessity of partial slip in the area of contact. Previous investigations suggest that this slip cannot occur at the leading edge of the contact circle, so that a system of tractions is found which corresponds to zero stress at the leading point. It is shown that such a system of tractions gives rise to a transverse creep of the sphere in the direction of its rotation Ω. The magnitude of this creep is calculated for small values of Ω, when slip occurs to only a small extent. Experiments have been performed using a simple thrust bearing with plane parallel races. As the bearing rotates, the balls creep radially outward in the predicted manner. Quantitative measurements of this creep agree with the theoretical estimate over a wide range.},

            There are three basic finite element formulations, which are used in multibody dynamics. These are the floating frame reference approach, the incremental method and the large rotation vector approach. In the floating frame of reference and incremental formulations, the slopes are assumed small in order to define infinitesimal rotations that can be treated and transformed as vectors. This description, however, limits the use of some important elements such as beams and plates in a wide range of large displacement applications. As demonstrated in some recent publications, if infinitesimal rotations are used as nodal coordinates, the use of the finite element incremental formulation in the large reference displacement analysis does not lead to exact modeling of the rigid body inertia when the structures rotate as rigid bodies.
            In this paper, a new and simple finite element procedure that employs the mathematical definition of the slope and uses it to define the element coordinates instead of the infinitesimal and finite rotations is developed for large rotation and deformation problems. By using this description and by defining the element coordinates in the global system, not only the need for performing coordinate transformation is avoided, but also a simple expression for the inertia forces is obtained. Furthermore, the resulting mass matrix is constant and it is the same matrix that appears in linear structural dynamics.
            It is demonstrated in this paper, that this coordinate description leads to exact modeling of the rigid body inertia when the structure rotate as rigid bodies. Nonetheless, the stiffness matrix becomes nonlinear function of time even in the case of small displacements.
            The method presented in this paper differs from previous large rotation vector formulations in the sense that the inertia forces, the kinetic energy, and the strain energy are not expressed in terms of any orientation coordinates, and therefore, the method does not require interpolation of finite rotations. While the use of the formulation is demonstrated using a simple planar beam element, the generalization of the method to other element types and to the three dimensional case is straightforward. Using the finite element procedure presented in this paper, beams and plates can be treated as isoparametric elements.},

	abstract = {The floating frame of reference formulation is currently the most widely used approach in flexible multibody simulations. The use of this approach, however, has been limited to small deformation problems. In this investigation, the computer implementation of the newabsolute nodal co-ordinate formulationand its use in the small and large deformation analysis of flexible multibody systems that consist of interconnected bodies are discussed. While in the floating frame of reference formulation a mixed set of absolute reference and local elastic co-ordinates are used, in the absolute nodal co-ordinate formulation only absolute co-ordinates are used. In the absolute nodal co-ordinate formulation, new interpretation of the nodal co-ordinates of the finite elements is used. No infinitesimal or finite rotations are used as nodal co-ordinates from beams and plates, instead, global slopes are used to define the element nodal co-ordinates. Using this interpretation of the element co-ordinates, beams and plates can be considered as isoparametric elements, and as a result, exact modelling of the rigid body dynamics can be obtained using the element shape function and the absolute nodal co-ordinates. Unlike the floating frame of reference approach, no co-ordinate transformation is required in order to determine the element inertia. The mass matrix of the finite elements is a constant matrix, and therefore, the centrifugal and Coriolis forces are equal to zero when the absolute nodal co-ordinate formulation is used. Another advantage of using the absolute nodal co-ordinate formulation in the dynamic simulation of multibody systems is its simplicity in imposing some of the joint constraints and also its simplicity in formulating the generalized forces due to spring-damper elements. The results obtained in this investigation show an excellent agreement with the results obtained using the floating frame of reference formulation when large rotation–small deformation problems are considered.},

Numerical tests demonstrate that this effectively is a more robust procedure. In particular, when the objects are found in contact, the newly proposed subalgorithm runs from 15\% to 30\% times faster than the original one. The improved performance has a significant impact on various applications, such as real-time simulations and collision avoidance systems. Altogether, the main contributions made to the GJK algorithm are faster convergence rate and reduced computational time. These improvements may be easily added into existing implementations; furthermore, engineering applications that require solutions of distance queries to machine precision can now be tackled using the GJK algorithm.},

In the hybrid algorithm developed in this investigation, the off-line search that can be effectively used for the tread contact is switched to the on-line search when the contact point is jumped to the flange region. In the two-point contact scenarios encountered in curve negotiations, the on-line search is used for both tread and flange contacts to determine the two-point contact configuration. By so doing, contact points on the flange region given by the off-line tabular search are never used, but rather used as an initial estimate for the online iterative procedure for improving the numerical convergence. Furthermore, the continual on-line detection of the second point of contact is replaced with a simple table look-up. It is demonstrated by several numerical examples that include flange climb and curve negotiation scenarios that the proposed hybrid contact search algorithm can be effectively used for modeling wheel/rail contacts in the analysis of general multibody railroad vehicle dynamics.},

	abstract = {Euler parameters do not suffer from the kinematic singularity associated with the three-parameter representation of the rotation. For this reason, the four Euler parameters are widely used in describing the motion of rigid bodies in space. These parameters are related by an algebraic equation which must be satisfied at the position, velocity, and acceleration levels. However, the constraint forces associated with Euler parameter constraints are always zero and lead to a kinetic singularity when a certain solution procedure is used to solve for the accelerations. It is shown in this paper that when the equations are formulated in terms of Euler parameters, the use of a solution procedure for the accelerations that requires the elimination of Lagrange multipliers leads to a singular coefficient matrix. Since Lagrange multipliers associated with Euler parameters constraints always define zero constraint forces, a nonsingular coefficient matrix can be identified and used to solve for Lagrange multipliers associated with other joint constraints. The proposed solution procedure requires the inverse of a 3 × 3 constant matrix for each rigid body in the system and the LU solution of a system of algebraic equations that has dimension equal to the number of constraint equations excluding Euler parameters constraints.},

The orientation of the beam’s cross section is parameterized by means of slope vectors. Both a structural mechanics based formulation of the elastic forces based on Reissner’s nonlinear rod theory, as well as a continuum mechanics based formulation for a St. Venant Kirchhoff material are presented in this paper. The performance of the proposed finite beam element is investigated by the analysis of several static and linearized dynamic problems. A comparison to results provided in the literature, to analytical solutions, and to the solution found by commercial finite element software shows high accuracy and high order of convergence, and therefore the present element has high potential for geometrically nonlinear problems.},

	abstract = {Owing to repeated traffic loads, the ballast of a railroad track can become unevenly distributed, resulting in different settlements of adjacent sleepers and possibly to a sleeper–ballast loss of contact. The sleeper–ballast loss of contact can significantly change the stiffness properties and modes of deformation of the track. This in turn can cause damage to the structure and can lead to undesirable dynamic behaviour of the vehicles that negotiate this damaged track. The focus of this investigation is on developing a more comprehensive procedure that can be used to examine the effect produced by unsupported sleepers of a flexible track on the dynamics of railroad vehicle systems. The procedure used in this study is based on a validated non-linear multi-body railroad vehicle system formulation that takes into account the coupling between the elastic deformations of the track, the sleeper movements, and the three-dimensional contact parameters. The method used in this article allows for developing a detailed finite-element track model that accounts for non-periodic and asymmetrical mechanical defects. The finite-element equations of motion of the track that includes unsupported sleepers are integrated with the non-linear constrained dynamic equations of the multi-body railroad vehicle system. Component mode synthesis methods are used to reduce the number of the governing equations of motion and eliminate high-frequency modes. The dynamic coupling between the track modal co-ordinates and the wheel–rail contact parameters is considered in this investigation by using creepage and creep force expressions that depend on the track deformations and sleeper movements. In order to demonstrate the use of the procedure described in this article, a track model which has rails and sleepers modelled as beams rigidly connected at the intersection points is used. The effect of the ballast is considered using an elastic foundation. The results obtained in this investigation are used to compare between the responses of two tracks; one with no sleeper–ballast loss of support and the other with unsupported sleepers. The results are reported for different values of the forward velocities in order to have a better understanding of the effect of the sleeper loss of support on the system dynamics. The creepages that depend on the track deformations as well as the system frequencies are analysed. The results obtained in this investigation are found to be in good agreement with the results reported in the literature on unsupported sleepers.},

Although the equations and matrices included show a complicated structure, the additional effort when combining the standard forward solver to the adjoint backward solver is kept in limits. Therefore, the adjoint method shows an efficient way to incorporate inverse dynamics to engineering multibody applications, e.g., trajectory tracking or parameter identification in the field of robotics. The present paper studies examples for both, parameter identification and optimal control, and shows the potential of the adjoint method in solving classical optimization problems in multibody dynamics.},

	abstract = {The dynamic analysis of the vehicle–flexible track interaction involves the study of vehicle motion and its dynamic impact transmitted to the track structure. This paper studies the influence of the out-of-round vehicle wheels running over rail welds on a flexible ballast track. The rails are modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam discretely supported by a spring-damper force element that represents the flexibility of the track structure. The dynamic behavior of the vehicle–flexible track interaction is studied using the combination of the finite element method and the multi-body system. In this paper, the simulation of the vehicle with the out-of-roundness wheel running over rail welds on a flexible ballast track in the high-frequency range and the vehicle–track interaction is coupled by a non-linear wheel–rail contact model. The effects of the out-of-roundness wheel on the vehicle–flexible track interaction at rail welds are investigated by comparing the effects of the round wheel under different vehicle speeds. Results indicate that the out-of-roundness wheel at rail welds creates a high magnitude dynamic effect on the vehicle and track components. The obtained simulation results were used to set a safety limitation for the wheel and rail irregularity size.},

	abstract = {A simple matrix expression is obtained for the strain components of a beam in which the displacements and rotations are large. The only restrictions are on the magnitudes of the strain and of the local rotation, a newly-identified kinematical quantity. The local rotation is defined as the change of orientation of material elements relative to the change of orientation of the beam reference triad. The vectors and tensors in the theory are resolved along orthogonal triads of base vectors centered along the undeformed and deformed beam reference axes, so Cartesian tensor notation is used. Although a curvilinear coordinate system is natural to the beam problem, the complications usually associated with its use are circumvented. Local rotations appear explicitly in the resulting strain expressions, facilitating the treatment of beams with both open and closed cross sections in applications of the theory. The theory is used to obtain the kinematical relations for coupled bending, torsion, extension, shear deformation, and warping of an initially curved and twisted beam.},

In this work, bogie’s static and dynamic condition results are investigated in predetermined scenarios. Considering the technical specifications of UIC-515-4, bogie’s static structure and dynamic analysis are performed and results obtained by Von-Misses stress method and modal analysis are presented. Air springs are used on secondary suspension system and helical springs and rubber cushions are used on primary suspension system. In the paper, firstly, the methodology of analysis is explained. Bogie’s frame’s parts are defined as separate bodies in a monolith structure in CAD environment which makes the meshing process easy and flexible. Dampers, which damp effects of bounce, pitch and roll and equivalent springs for the primary and secondary suspension systems are defined. Rubber cushion’s lateral rigidities and the complex geometry problems are overcome with analytical assumptions to provide equivalent linear stiffness character. Finally, the analysis made in computer environment by using finite elements method shows that the trailer bogie has strength in the safety limits and acceptable mode shapes with their natural frequencies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an effort to use multi-body dynamics with unilateral contact to model the friction wedge interaction with the bolster and the side frame. The new friction wedge model is a 3D, dynamic, stand-alone model of a bolster-friction wedge-side frame assembly. It allows the wedge four degrees of freedom: vertical displacement, longitudinal (between the bolster and the side frame) displacement, toe-in and toe-out, and yaw (rotation about the vertical axis). The dedicated train modeling software NUCARS® has been used to run simulations with similar inputs and to compare — when possible — the results with those obtained from the new stand-alone MATLAB friction wedge model. The stand-alone model shows improvement in capturing the transient dynamics of the wedge better. Also, it can predict not only normal forces going into the frame and bolster, but also use the associated moments to enhance model behavior. Significant simulation results are presented and the main differences between the current NUCARS® model and the new stand-alone MATLAB models are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Prediction of the evolution of rail (and wheel) proﬁles using design tools that integrate multi-body dynamics (MBD) simulations of track and rail vehicles with tribological models of material removal are well established and well documented. The most adopted approach within the UK utilises the relationship between material loss and energy at the contact using the Tγ parameter. This relies on establishing wear coefﬁcients using rolling/sliding wear experiments. Experimental data exists only for dry contact conditions, the use of which can introduce errors in forces and wear amounts when considering contacts with third-body materials such as water and grease present. The work outlined within this paper was aimed at producing new Tγ wear curves and creep curves for 260 grade rail and R8T wheel materials using a twin disc testing technique (at 1500 MPa, varying slip to achieve different Tγ values and 400 rpm), for dry, water and grease lubricated conditions for the ﬁrst time. Surface and subsurface analysis of test samples was carried out to identify the wear processes taking place under these differing contact conditions. Data from the tests can be used to improve predictions from MBD simulations.},

	abstract = {One of the issues in the railway ﬁeld is the damage caused by wear and RCF which deeply aﬀects wheel and rail. These phenomena are closely connected and directly impact both on vehicle dynamics (comfort, stability, safety, etc.) and on the costs (line management, maintenance, etc.), decreasing the useful life of wheel and rail. To face these problems and detect abnormal operating conditions, this work aims at developing a modelling approach for railway and tramway applications that eﬀectively combines wear and RCF models. The former has been validated by means of on-ﬁeld experimental data whereas the latter through speciﬁc laboratory tests carried out on a dedicated test-rig. The proposed approach is capable of simultaneously predicting both the proﬁles shape evolution due to wear and the total RCF damage along the wheel and rail proﬁles, reaching a good compromise between accuracy and eﬃciency. Thanks to the high numerical eﬃciency, the wear-RCF model can be easily implemented into complex multibody models of railway and tramway vehicles to perform large-scale simulations.},

	abstract = {The dynamic analysis of railway vehicles involves the construction of three independent models: the vehicle model; the track model; and the wheel-rail contact model. In this work, a multibody formulation with Cartesian coordinates is used to describe the kinematic structure of the rigid bodies and joints that constitute the vehicle model. A methodology is also proposed in order to create detailed three-dimensional track models, which includes the flexibility of the rails and of the substructure. Here, the finite element methodology is used to model the rails as beams supported in a discrete manner by spring-damper systems that represent the flexibility of the pads, sleepers, ballast and substructure. The inclusion of flexible track models is very important to study the dynamic behavior of railway vehicles in realistic operation scenarios, especially when studying the impact of train operations on the infrastructure and, conversely, the damages on vehicles provoked by the track conditions. This topic has a significant economic impact on the vehicles maintenance and also affects the life cycle costs of tracks. The wheel-rail contact formulation used here allows obtaining, online during the dynamic analysis, the contact points location, even for the most general three-dimensional motion of the wheelsets with respect to the track. The methodology proposed to build flexible track models is validated here by comparing the results obtained with this new approach with the ones obtained with ANSYS. Furthermore, the methodology is demonstrated by studying the dynamic behavior of the Alfa Pendular railway vehicle.},

	abstract = {A long term investigation of the wheel and the rail wear condition reveals that wheel ﬂange wear and rail gauge corner wear are serious problems for EMU vehicles and narrow curved tracks. In order to solve the problem, the effects of bogie key parameters on the vehicle dynamic behaviour were studied using an EMU vehicle dynamic model and the improved parallel inverse design method was employed to design a new wheel proﬁle. The results show that under the condition of a high primary yaw stiffness, the yawing motion of the wheelset is limited, which leads to a high-angle of attack between wheel and rail on narrow curves. Then two-point contact between the wheel and the rail could occur and cause serious wheel ﬂange wear and rail gauge corner wear. The new designed proﬁle can reduce wheel ﬂange wear and rail gauge corner wear, while meeting the safety requirement of vehicle running performance on tangent track. The primary yaw stiffness affects the curving negotiation performance signiﬁcantly.},

Wear maps and damage mechanism maps of wheel material under both dry and wet conditions were constructed. Based on the wear rates of the wheel rollers, the wear map of CL60 wheel material under dry conditions was divided into three areas: mild wear area, severe wear area and catastrophic wear area. While, the wear map under wet condition was divided into two areas: ultra mild wear area and mild wear area. Through the damage mechanism maps, it could be observed that the surface damage transforms from pitting to delamination under dry condition and the peeling damage was gradually aggravated with the increase in slip ratio and contact pressure. Under the wet condition, plowing damage was predominant and delamination damage gradually occurred with the increase in slip ratio and contact pressure.},

	abstract = {Improving freight axle load is the most effective method to improve railway freight capability; based on the imported technologies of railway freight bogie, the 27 t axle load side-frame cross-bracing bogie and sub-frame radial bogie are developed in China. In order to analyze and compare dynamic interactions of the two newly developed heavy-haul freight bogies, we establish a vehicle–track coupling dynamic model and use numerical calculation methods for computer simulation. The dynamic performances of the two bogies are simulated separately at various conditions. The results show that at the dipped joint and straight line running conditions, the wheel–rail dynamic interactions of both bogies are basically the same, but at the curve negotiation condition, the wear and the lateral force of the side-frame cross-bracing bogie are much higher than that of the sub-frame radial bogie, and the advantages become more obvious when the curve radius is smaller. The results also indicate that the subframe radial bogie has better low-wheel–rail interaction characteristics.},

Learning and Artificial Intelligence” in order to provide a set of
ethical principles and recommendations that are conversant with

	abstract = {The term “Industry 4.0” symbolizes new forms of
technology and artificial intelligence within production
technologies. Smart robots are going to be the game changers
within the factories of the future and will work with humans in
indispensable teams within many processes. With this fourth
industrial revolution, classical production lines are going through
comprehensive modernization, e.g. in terms of in-the-box
manufacturing, where humans and machines work side by side in
so-called “hybrid teams”. Questions about how to prepare for
newly needed engineering competencies for the age of Industry 4.0,
how to assess them and how to teach and train e.g. human-robotteams
have to be tackled in future engineering education. The
paper presents theoretical aspects and empirical results of a series
of studies, carried out to investigate the competencies of virtual
collaboration and joint problem solving in virtual worlds.},

	abstract = {In April 2014, VDI The Association of German Engineers
and ASME American Society of Mechanical
Engineers joined efforts to study the impact of industrial
innovation on the role of humans in the future of
manufacturing. A team of ten early career engineers
from diverse sectors of industry and academia worked
for eight months to research the development needs of
the workforce in the factory of the future, to identify
the current challenges, and to recommend initiatives
to prepare the future workforce for changes in their
work environment. The ongoing initiatives of the
Advanced Manufacturing Program and Industry 4.0
led by the United States and Germany respectively
were reviewed to identify areas for joint collaborative
efforts and prepare industry for the technology and
workforce demands of the factory of the future.
The manufacturing sector is very important for future
economic growth in manufacturing-based economies
such as the USA and Germany. Industrial history has
shown that the progression of manufacturing has
grown in revolutions versus steady changes. Current
technological improvements are converging towards
the possibility of another one of these aforementioned
revolutions. In an effort to strengthen and increase
their respective economies and manufacturing sectors,
the USA and Germany have funded initiatives to spur
on this revolution. The USA refers to their program as
the Advanced Manufacturing Program and Germany
refers to theirs as Industry 4.0. With these ideas in
mind, a small coalition of German and American
early career engineers collaborated to contribute to the
discussion on what could be done to supplement these
movements. While the programs address the further
development of critical technologies to revolutionize
the manufacturing industry, the creation of a workforce
that can be effective in the environments created
by those revolutions remain mostly unaddressed.
Discussion and exploration of skilled labor forces
interacting with new technologies and the resulting
aspects of these technologies were used to derive an
understanding of the necessary qualifications and
skills that will be needed by future skilled labor forces.
This future factory environment and personnel
roles imagined in this discussion were then subsequently
used to compile a list of recommendations
and ideas of how organizations such as VDI and
ASME can positively contribute to the advanced
manufacturing movement.},

The concept behind these solutions is to break the paradigm of automation layers based on their functions instead of their hierarchical level. In this sense, a new architecture is needed to address the needs that arise from the perspective of Industry 4.0. The purpose of this article is to propose a new architecture based on integrated functions to meet the current requirements of production systems. An analysis of case studies of automation solutions deployed in real-world production systems is performed and the results can be used for further discussions on this research topic.},

Arrhenius plots of this reactivated activity at a constant pH of 7.0 and an Mg2+: ATP mol ratio of 1:1 showed a discontinuity (sharp change of slope) at 17 degrees C, with activation energy (Ea) values of 13-15 kcal/mol above this temperature and 30-35 kcal below it. A further discontinuity was also found at 8.0 degrees C and the Ea below this was very high (greater than 100 kcal/mol). Increased Mg2+ concentrations at Mg2+:ATP ratios in excess of 1:1 inhibited the (Na+ +K+)-ATPase activity and also abolished the discontinuities in the Arrhenius plots. The addition of cholesterol to phosphatidylserine at a 1:1 mol ratio partially inhibited (Na+ +K+)-ATPase reactivation. Arrhenius plots under these conditions showed a single discontinuity at 20 degrees C and Ea values of 22 and 68 kcal/mol above and below this temperature respectively. The ouabain-insensitive Mg2+-ATPase normally showed a linear Arrhenius plot with an Ea of 8 kcal/mol. The cholesterol-phosphatidylserine mixed liposomes stimulated the Mg2+-ATPase activity, which now also showed a discontinuity at 20 degrees C with, however, an increased value of 14 kcal/mol above this temperature and 6 kcal/mol below. Kinetic studies showed that cholesterol had no significant effect on the Km values for ATP. Since both cholesterol and Mg2+ are known to alter the effects of temperature on the fluidity of phospholipids, the above results are discussed in this context.},

	abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;This paper presents two new dynamic hysteresis models obtained from the Bouc–Wen model by incorporating position and acceleration information. On the one hand, the model employing position information is rate-independent and it is able to reproduce some kind of double hysteretic loops unable to be reproduced with the original Bouc–Wen model. On the other hand, the model employing acceleration information is insensitive to linear time-scale variations. Moreover, a classification of the BIBO-stable models has been derived for both position and acceleration cases. Double hysteretic loops have been experimentally reported in shape-memory alloys, reinforced concrete structures, wood structures and lightweight steel shear wall structures. The proposed hysteretic models represent a prominent use in the field of structural dynamics and earthquake engineering because they can capture the nonlinear dynamics of the materials and structures presented earlier when they are subjected to dynamic loads as earthquake excitations.},

	abstract = {The floating frame of reference formulation which is widely used in flexible multibody simulations leads to a highly non-linear inertia matrix. This matrix which exhibits a strong inertia coupling between the reference motion and the elastic deformation can be expressed in terms of a unique set of inertia shape integrals that depend on the assumed displacement field. In this paper, we demonstrate that the floating frame of reference formulation leads to the same dynamic relationship obtained using large deformation finite element formulations. This result clearly demonstrates that the floating frame of reference formulation can also be used in the large deformation analysis of constrained flexible bodies provided that no infinitesimal or finite rotations are used as nodal coordinates; instead, displacements and slopes are used to describe the element configuration. The relationship between the local and the global slopes is defined and used to establish a coordinate transformation which is used to demonstrate the equivalence of the dynamic relationships and the inertia forces obtained using two different finite element formulations. Using this equivalence relationship, a simple and systematic procedure for evaluating all the inertia shape integrals that appear in the floating frame of reference formulation from the constant mass matrix that appears in linear structural dynamics is developed. In order to develop this procedure, the concepts of the local and global shape functions are introduced. The local shape function, which is used in the floating frame of reference formulation, does not have any rigid body modes and is defined using an appropriate set of reference conditions. The global shape function, on the other hand, has a complete set of rigid body modes that can describe an arbitrary rigid body displacement. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the floating frame of reference formulation does not lead to a separation between the rigid body motion and the elastic deformation, and in such a formulation, the reference motion cannot be considered as the rigid body motion of the deformable body.},

These force models which account for the coupling between bending and axial deformations are derived using a continuum mechanics approach, without the need for introducing a local element co-ordinate system. Four new different force models that include different degrees of complexity are presented. It is shown that the vector of the elastic forces can be significantly simplified as compared to the elastic force model developed for the absolute nodal co-ordinate formulation using a local element frame [1]. Despite the simplicity of the new models, they account for elastic non-linearity in the strain–displacement relationship. Therefore, they lead to more accurate results as compared to the more complex models developed using the local frame method which does not account for the non-linearities in the strain–displacement relationships. Numerical results are presented in order to demonstrate the use of the new models and test their performances in the analysis of large deformations of flexible multibody systems.},

	title = {A comprehensive model of the railway wheelset–track interaction in curves},
	volume = {333},
	abstract = {Train–track interaction has been extensively studied in the last 40 years at least, leading to modelling approaches that can deal satisfactorily with many dynamic problems arising at the wheel/rail interface. However, the available models are usually not considering specifically the running dynamics of the vehicle in a curve, whereas a number of train–track interaction phenomena are specific to curve negotiation. The aim of this paper is to define a model for a flexible wheelset running on a flexible curved track. The main novelty of this work is to combine a trajectory coordinate set with Eulerian modal coordinates; the former permits to consider curved tracks, and the latter models the small relative displacements between the trajectory frame and the solid. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the problem, one single flexible wheelset is considered instead of one complete bogie, and suitable forces are prescribed at the primary suspension seats so that the mean values of the creepages and contact forces are consistent with the low frequency curving dynamics of the complete vehicle. The wheelset model is coupled to a cyclic track model having constant curvature by means of a wheel/rail contact model which accounts for the actual geometry of the contacting profiles and for the nonlinear relationship between creepages and creep forces. The proposed model can be used to analyse a variety of dynamic problems for railway vehicles, including rail corrugation and wheel polygonalisation, squeal noise, numerical estimation of the wheelset service loads. In this paper, simulation results are presented for some selected running conditions to exemplify the application of the model to the study of realistic train–track interaction cases and to point out the importance of curve negotiation effects specifically addressed in the work.},

	abstract = {In this investigation, a non-linear finite-element formulation for modelling the rail structural flexibility in multi-body railroad vehicle systems is presented. Two different types of interpolations are used in the kinematic equations developed in this study; the geometry interpolation and the deformation interpolation. In the proposed formulation, the rails can have arbitrary geometry, which is described using the isoparametric geometric interpolation. The coordinates of the polynomials used in this interpolation represent constant position and gradient coordinates, which can be used to describe accurately the rail geometry. On the other hand, the rail deflections are described using the deformation interpolation and the non-linear finite-element floating frame of reference formulation. In the formulation proposed in this investigation, the rail tangent and normal vectors as well as other geometric parameters such as the curvature and torsion at the wheel/rail contact points are expressed in terms of the rail deformation coordinates. The non-linear dynamic coupling between the rail geometry and the vehicle dynamics is also considered in the formulation proposed in this paper. In particular, the coupling between the rail deformation and geometry, contact coordinates, and the non-linear vehicle dynamics is taken into consideration. Furthermore, the longitudinal, lateral, and spin creepages are expressed in terms of the rail deformations, which are the result of the wheel/rail contact forces. This non-linear coupled analysis allows for more accurate prediction of the railroad vehicle dynamics. The main outcome of this study is the development of a new procedure that allows building a complex track model that includes significant details using a finite-element preprocessor computer program. The detailed track model can be used as an input to a general purpose flexible multi-body computer program for a non-linear analysis that accounts for the dynamic coupling between the track flexibility and the vehicle coordinates. Numerical results are presented in order to demonstrate the use of the formulation proposed in this study.},

	abstract = {In a previous investigation, a non-linear finite element formulation for modelling rail structural flexibility in multibody railroad vehicle systems was presented. This formulation required the use of isoparametric interpolation based on the finite element absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) in order to have a consistent interpolation for the geometry in the current deformed configuration. That is, the same interpolation functions used for the geometry description in the undeformed reference state are also used for predicting the geometry in the current deformed state. This approach, however, becomes less attractive when a degree of derivative continuity higher than the one provided by ANCF elements is required. In this investigation, an alternate simpler approach is proposed for modelling rail and track flexibility. The proposed new method, which is based on the floating frame of reference formulation, allows for general modelling of rail and track flexibility, can be used to impose a higher degree of continuity on the derivatives at the nodes that define the rail geometry in the reference configuration, and can be used to systematically couple finite element computer programs with flexible multibody system codes, allowing for the development of detailed track models that include rail, tie, and fastener flexibility as well as soil characteristics. In the proposed method, track geometry is defined in a preprocessor computer program using nodal points. In addition to the location of the nodes and Euler angles that define the orientation of the profile frame at the nodes, first, second, and third derivatives of the locations and Euler angles are defined by the preprocessor computer program. Numerical examples are presented in order to demonstrate the effect of track deformation in railroad applications.},

In the existing beam element in this formulation, because the elastic forces are defined using the Green-Lagrange strain tensor as a volume element, locking phenomenon associated with the shear and cross-section deformation leads to erroneously stiffer bending characteristics. In order to circumvent this drawback, the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle is applied to modify the shear stress distribution, whereas the assumed strain method is employed to alleviate the locking associated with the cross-section deformation. The consistent tangent stiffness matrices are derived for the curved beam element and used with implicit integration methods.

For instance such a representation does not capture the rotation of the beam as a rigid body about its own axis. This problem was circumvented in the literature by using a local coordinate system in the incremental finite element method or by using the multibody floating frame of reference formulation. The use of such a local element coordinate system leads to a highly nonlinear expression for the inertia forces as the result of the large element rotation. In this investigation, an absolute nodal coordinate formulation is presented for the large rotation and deformation analysis of three dimensional beam elements. This formulation leads to a constant mass matrix, and as a result, the vectors of the centrifugal and Coriolis forces are identically equal to zero. The formulation presented in this paper takes into account the effect of rotary inertia, torsion and shear, and ensures continuity of the slopes as well as the rotation of the beam cross section at the nodal points. Using the proposed formulation curved beams can be systematically modeled.},

	abstract = {This part of these two companion papers demonstrates the computer implementation of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation for three-dimensional beam elements. Two beam elements that relax the assumptions of Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories are developed. These two elements take into account the effect of rotary inertia, shear deformation and torsion, and yet they lead to a constant mass matrix. As a consequence, the Coriolis and centrifugal forces are identically equal to zero. Both beam elements use the same interpolating polynomials and have the same number of nodal coordinates. However, one of the elements has two nodes, while the other has four nodes. The results obtained using the two elements are compared with the results obtained using existing incremental methods. Unlike existing large rotation vector formulations, the results of this paper show that no special numerical integration methods need to be used in order to satisfy the principle of work and energy when the absolute nodal coordinate formulation is used. These results show that this formulation can be used in manufacturing applications such as high speed forming and extrusion problems in which the element cross section dimensions significantly change.},

Three different \{C1\} trigonometric trial functions that allow the recovery of incremental rigid body motions are investigated. The attributes and deficiencies of the various elements are examined and discussed via several problems which have been designed to evaluate the performance of the element. The 4U4W element is shown to be the best choice of those elements considered here.},

The element formulations developed by these inverse strategies are obtained in local coordinates. As no shape functions are employed in their development transforming them to global coordinates is a challenge and prevents their use in practical finite element models. To remove this obstacle a new method is proposed to obtain shape functions for superconvergent element models attained directly from the eigen-value convergence analysis or discretization error analysis. The method employs series of trigonometric functions to obtain shape functions corresponding to the superconvergent element formulations. Using the proposed strategy, the shape functions for superconvergent rod, beam and transverse vibration membrane are obtained. It is shown transformation of the superconvergent element formulation to the global coordinates using the obtained shape functions does not affect the eigen-value convergence rates.},
